# Week 13 Outline

## Search Tools and Theory

+ Ana (Rosenberg)
+ Aly (Underwood)
+ (Leary)
	+ how can we update this? Think about accessibility vs net-neutrality, think about 
alternatives to word search, like keyword tagging on JSTOR and neural networks
+ Have Rebecca talk about her search practices in her seminar paper

## Search Practice in LAS

### Robert Audley’s Brief

+ Pseudo-legal research: institutionalization of knowledge
+ Compare with Dr. Mosgrave: acting professionally but also lawyeristically 

### How are systems of knowledge used by different classes/individuals?

+ Katie’s seminar paper: look at servants and panopticism
+ Servants traffic information within the story; Robert Audley acts diegetically. 
+ Compare Phoebe to Luke: she is the model, loyal servant and she shares information; he is ungrateful and he holds the secret: without Luke there is no story
+ What is the effect of this story being unravelled by Robert Audley?
+ both impersonal because of his nature and relation but also deeply passionate because it comes from the heart and is unusual for him
+ Robert Audley info management techniques?
+ Information as a facet of the novel: how does the rollout of information offer opportunities to look at the story from a variety of perspectives (or not?)
	
## The Secret

+ What is it?
+ Elaine Showalter famously argued, “Lady Audley’s real secret is that she is 
sane, and, moreover, representative”
+ The novel’s moral priorities: murder is downplayed, female madness exaggerated, bigamy as a buzzword
+ What/when did Lady Audley do wrong? Are you pro- or anti-Lady Audley? Is she sympathetic?

## Women and Insanity

+ Historical context: expectation of domesticity, prevalence of asylums
+ Monstrous beauty (cf. Hetty Sorrel)
+ See Rebecca’s seminar paper of demoniac aspects 

## Comparisons

+ Emma’s close reading: Phoebe’s resemblance to Lady Audley 
+ What do we make of Phoebe being a pale Lady Audley?
	+ what implications are there that the novel does not fully realize?
+ Amy’s close reading: Alicia’s opposition to Lady Audley
+ What do we get from these comparisons? 
+ Lady Audley as more like Phoebe than Alicia, revealing her as an imposter in her house?
+ Robert Audley’s opposition to Lady Audley
+ He is lymphatic (even-tempered), she is maniacal (feverish)
+ He is honest, she is lying.
+ Why are there so many comparisons that center around Lady Audley? Can she be a character defined on her own? Is she playing a character, or is she herself?

+ Think about honesty: Why is Robert Audley so honest towards Lady Audley? Especially 
because he decides to hide her murder from everyone else and ultimately circumvents the law?
+ How does Lady Audley deal with dishonesty? She lives a lie, but she uses the truth (see: 
telling Sir Michael that Robert thinks she’s a murdered George Talboys)

## The gay/homosocial

+ Robert and George (Robert choosing Clara because she’s basically George)
+ Luke’s sympathy, misogyny, and secret keeping
+ Contrast to lack of close relationships between women
	+ lack of emotional connection, largely economic system

## Sensation novel as genre

### Tristan’s close reading: the upper class is not immune from crime
+ Genre as challenging realist fiction--or a suspicious reading of realist fiction?
+ Look at the opening paragraphs: why does it begin this way?
+ Is the novel realistic? Compare to *Hard Cash* and *OMF* (both of which include sensational elements)
	+ think about this piecemeal. Alicia exits the sensationalism and enters realism. How 
else are characters and treatments shifting between style?
+ As challenging the middle class and embodying middle class fears
+ Criticism of sensation novels (Katie)
+ Sensational depictions of insanity in *Hard Cash* and *LAS*
+ Gothic influence: architecture (Audley, asylum, burning inn), characterizations, horror-asides
+ A way to think about evilness, madness, fear

### Art’s close reading of language
+ Relates back to Poovey on Trollope’s series
+ Are these notes in *LAS* equally as distracting? Is that okay in a sensation novel?

+ Topic modeling demo?
