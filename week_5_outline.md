# Outline Week 5

## Bakhtin

### Leila’s paper
What is the significance of the link between Headstone and Rokesmith’s language in their respective marriage proposals?

How does Bakhtin argue that Dickens is using language in these scenes?

+ Both of them speaking not _in_ language, but rather _through_ language - how and why? 
+ How are Dickens’s intentions mingled with Headstone and Rokesmith’s intentions in each of their scenes? 
- What can Dickens’s notes tell us about this?

### Language
 How does Bakhtin’s conception of language relate to our understanding of fiction and realism?

-       Language treated “as objects, as typifactions, as local color” (288)
-       Literary language as a “dialogue of languages” (294)

### Poetry vs. Prose
Willa’s questions

Isn’t poetry also highly referential?
Is poetry necessarily highbrow/novel lowbrow?
 Is this distinction necessary + what do we gain and/or lose from it?
What’s Bakhtin’s overall objective in this book?
Language as “ideologically saturated, language as a world view, even as a concrete opinion…” (271)

(Is this accurate? Does the language of prose really not do this?)
What can Hack’s close reading at a distance and Underwood, Bamman, and Lee’s distant reading contribute here?

### The English comic novel
Bakhtin’s close readings of Little Dorrit and passages from other novels
Hybrid constructions and pseudo-objective motivations

How do they compare/relate to Cohn’s narrated monologues?
Especially with regard to comic style and the tendency of narrated monologues towards attitudes of sympathy/irony
What is the effect of comedy on realism?
Parodic stylization such that incorporated languages are revealed to be “inadequate to reality” (311)
 [Am I confusing two different uses of the term “realism” here?]
Narrators and character zones

How might these connect to Dickens, Cohn’s narrated monologue, Trollope as a narrator?

### Dickens’s narrative in _Our Mutual Friend_
 Rebecca on Mr. Wegg

Narrative contrast and moral judgment
See very beginning of book 2, chapter 10
>“There was grief in the aristocratic house, and there was joy in the Bower. Mr Wegg argued, if an orphan were wanted, was he not an orphan himself; and could a better be desired? And why go beating about Brentford bushes, seeking orphans forsooth who had established no claims upon you and made no sacrifices for you, when here was an orphan ready to your hand who had given up in your cause, Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker?
Mr Wegg chuckled, consequently, when he heard the tidings. Nay, it was afterwards affirmed by a witness who shall at present be nameless, that in the seclusion of the Bower he poked out his wooden leg, in the stage-ballet manner, and executed a taunting or triumphant pirouette on the genuine leg remaining to him.”


 Emma on Bella Wilfer’s mercenary aspirations

Free indirect discourse and “the lovely woman”
See chapter 8
>“And then, as they sat looking at the ships and steamboats making their way to the sea with the tide that was running down, the lovely woman imagined all sorts of voyages for herself and Pa. Now, Pa, in the character of owner of a lumbering square-sailed collier, was tacking away to Newcastle, to fetch black diamonds to make his fortune with; now, Pa was going to China in that handsome threemasted ship, to bring home opium, with which he would for ever cut out Chicksey Veneering and Stobbles, and to bring home silks and shawls without end for the decoration of his charming daughter. Now, John Harmon’s disastrous fate was all a dream, and he had come home and found the lovely woman just the article for him, and the lovely woman had found him just the article for her, and they were going away on a trip, in their gallant bark, to look after their vines, with streamers flying at all points, a band playing on deck and Pa established in the great cabin.”

## Break 

## Hack

### What are the stakes of Hack’s argument?

### Victorian literature and African American literature as important archives for each other
Thinking about reception, re-use, repetition, the concept of archive

What do we gain from this?
How could Dickens’s notes be useful for this, if we were to think about _Our Mutual Friend_ in this context?
Or Butt and Tillotson on Dickens as a serial novelist

### What is “canonical” British literature, and what does it do?

### Hack’s method of close reading at a distance
Attention to “the text itself” as well as work’s “geographic dispersal and uptake, especially by readerships not envisioned or addressed by the work itself (3)

How does this compare to Underwood, Bamman, Lee’s method and objective?
 
### What is our own distance from these texts? —> Art’s paper

### Art’s paper
Recontextualization as destabilization/reclamation
“Two Men in a Boat,” by zlot

Fanfiction as archive/reuse/citation
How does the “what if?” question in fanfiction also speak to Hack’s argument?
What does fanfiction mean for OMF’s geographic dispersal + uptake
And what about the movement through time and space of that fanfic?

## Underwood, Bamman, Lee

### Transformation of gender
Measuring the “diachronic instability of gender categories”--binary gender categories “became less central to characterization” over time (12,11)

“While gender roles were becoming more flexible, the space actually allotted to (real, and fictional) women on the shelves of libraries was contracting sharply” (1)
Were you surprised by this?
What do we think of the quantitative methods used?

What can looking at English-language fiction from 1703-2009 tell us about Victorian literature specifically? 
What insights can we gain into _Our Mutual Friend_? Or is this a misguided line of questioning--to what extent do we need to put quantitative study, close reading, and book history side by side? 
Looking at the theoretical questions left open: how should we understand these changes in gender categories?
How might one go about studying perspectival instability, as suggested in the conclusion?
What other questions might we have that we think Underwood et al’s datasets and method could answer?  
 
## Last week on _Our Mutual Friends_ [weave this stuff throughout outline?]

### Lots of changing characters
Bella Wilfer

Her changing/~budding~ relationships with her family, Rokesmith, Lizzie

Emma on Mastodon: child/father relationships - parallel between Jenny Wren and Bella Wilfer?

Mr. Boffin’s miserhood

Mrs. Lammle’s change of conscience

Bradley Headstone - yikes

### John Rokesmith/Harmon/Julius Handford’s conversation with himself

### What to make of the characterization of Mr. Riah?
